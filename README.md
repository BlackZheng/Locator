Locator-Android
=====================
This android application is designed to location(GPS and Network) data collecting and analysis(mostly for positioning errors).

## How it work
=====================
 First, you need to save one location as referential point. Next time, when you collect new location data, it will be shown on Location Result and the distance between the new location and reference will be calculated as well. So you should collect data at the place as close to the reference as possible, so that the datas are useful.
You can save the location datas to a log.(store in /storage/emulated/0/Documents/<provider>_<the timestamp of reference>.txt], for example:/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Gps_1487492775.txt)
And you can clear the reference for collecting the data of a new place.
